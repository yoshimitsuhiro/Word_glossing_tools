A simple macro for Microsoft Word to set custom tab stops across a multi-tier interlinear morphemic gloss.

Simply import Tabulate_Glosses-v0.1.bas and Tabulate_Glosses_Prompt-v0.1.frm (make sure Tabulate_Glosses_Prompt-v0.1.frx is in the same folder when importing) in Visual Basic for Applications, then highlight one of more lines of an interlinear gloss and run the macro.

Set the indent (default: auto) and interval between each element (default: 10mm) in the user prompt. If the tabulated gloss is over a line long, try decreasing the interval. I will try to automate this in the next version.
